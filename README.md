### Hi there, My Name is Walid 👋

My education background is computer engineering but I really enjoy software development so I could claim my self as junior/ entry level software developer

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on PT. Salam Pacific Indonesia Lines ( SPIL )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.JS, PHP, Golang, and Java
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more projects that using SCRUM in order to get more familiar to work in a team!
- 📫 How to reach me: walidshr8@gmail.com

### Anyway, thank you for stopping by!🚁
